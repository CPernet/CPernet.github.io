  <h3>fMRI BOLD</h3>
  <h4> <br />
    <strong>Origins of the BOLD signal</strong></h4>
    <p>During information processing, there is an increase of neuronal activity in different parts of the  brain. This increase in neuronal activity elicits an increase in oxygen and  glucose consumption supplied by the vascular system. The MRI signal measured in  functional imaging is usually a signal that measures changes in the  microvasculature oxygenation. More precisely, it deals with venous oxygenation  (oxygenation in arteries is always 90-100%). The relationship between venous  oxygenation and the MR signal strength corresponds to images called Blood  Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) images.<br />
      </p> 
    <p>In 1936, Linus Pauling discovered that the hemoglobin molecule has magnetic  properties that differ depending upon whether or not it is bound to oxygen. The  oxygenated hemoglobine (Hb) is diamagnetic as it has no unpaired electron and  no magnetic moment. In contrast, the deoxyhemoglobin (dHd) is paramagnetic as  it has unpaired electron and magnetic moment. Thus, because blood deoxygenation  affects magnetic susceptibility, MR pulses used in fMRI should show more signal  for blood with oxygen (Hd) and less signal for blood deoxygenated (dHb) -  however we just saw that fMRI look at the venous system, i.e. where we have dHb  – How can we have more signal? PET studies using H2O15* and FDG* have shown that the regional cerebral  blood flow (rCBF) and the regional cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR) increase  during activation phases (neuronal stimulation). However, rCBF and rCMR are not  coupled. During activations, the rCMRO2 increase of 5% but the rCBF  increase of 29% (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/83/4/1140" target="new">Fox  &amp; Raichle, 1986</a>). More recent works that kept animals in hyperoxic or hyperglycemic states demonstrated that that the rCBF increase is not triggered by local sensing of depleted nutrients (see e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v30/n4/full/jcbfm2009259a.html" target="new">Lindauer et al., 2010</a>). </p>
    <p>The hyper-perfusion of the local tissue (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmr.a.10049/abstract" target="_top">McIntyre, et al. 2003</a>) is the basis of the BOLD contrast. At  rest, the oxygen level is around 95% in the arterial system and around 60-80%  in the venous system (Bandettini, 1999). During activation, the oxygen level  increases up to 90% in the venous system and the    Hb/dHb ratio increases. The relative decrease in dHb leads to a slower phase  decoupling of protons&rsquo; spin, and thus a T2* increase relative to rest. The role of the hyperperfusion is still debated:  high oxygenation might be required for waste removal and heat regulation (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/97/13/7603.abstract" target="new">Yablonskiy et al. 2000</a>), or to supply distale 
    active cells (<a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/31/38/13676.long" target="new">Devor et al. 2011</a>); hight flow might also be needed to provide higher levels of glucose (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/83/4/1140.long" target="new">Fox &amp; Raichle 1986</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/241/4864/462.long" target="new">Fox et al. 1988</a>,      <a href="http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v30/n1/full/jcbfm2009188a.html" target="new">Paulson et al. 2009</a>).</p>
    <p><strong>Spatial and temporal characteristics</strong></p>
    The BOLD signal increases about 2 sec after the neural activity; it then  reaches a plateau at about 5 – 8 sec. It will plateau if the neural activity  continues. Once the neural activity stops, the signal returns to baseline 8 to  11 sec later. Finally, a transient change referred to as the undershot can be  observed. Maximal variance is observed between subjects and minimal variance  between scans of the same subject (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381199890369X" target="new">Aguirre et al., 1998</a>). However, within subject variance  increases when comparing several areas – i.e. the shape of the hemodynamic  response is influenced by the vasculature and the task and these effects differ  from one area to the other.</p>
<p><img src="gfx/fmri/BOLD1.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="140" /> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Between areas of a given subject, one can observe temporal differences that  are believed to be the consequence of different spiking activity (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0193%281998%296:5/6%3C373::AID-HBM8%3E3.0.CO;2-P/abstract" target="new">Buckner 1998</a>) – but it can also be simple vascular effects.  Because within-subject variance is low at the peak of the hemodynamic response  (50-100ms), differences between conditions can be detected. Using fMRI one can  thus estimate the information flux across cerebral regions and between tasks (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811904001995" target="new">Pernet et al. 2004</a> – need to be an interaction).</p>
<p> <img src="gfx/fmri/BOLD3.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="255" align="top" /></p>
<p><em>From Pernet et al. 2004. The time to peak of the hrf varies between areas  and conditions, such as one can observe a significant interaction. Only in this  case neural differences between conditions can be inferred.</em></p>
<p>Considering that 80% of axons are local ones, vascular variations related to  metabolic changes are believed to be close to the real neural activation sites.  The spatial limit of the BOLD technique (not MRI technique) is currently around  4 mm (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223602000395" target="new">Ugurbil e al., 2003</a>). High functional imaging resolution can  however be achieved by increasing the field strength and using special  coils/imaging technique. Hi-res fMRI (i.e. nominal voxel sizes &lt; 2 mm3)  promises to help bridge the gap between the macro- and the microview of brain  function. At high field (&gt;3T) and using parallel imaging (Ugurbil et al.  2003), hi-res fMRI is invading the submillimeter range. However, even very high  resolution fMRI (0.47 x 0.47 x 3 mm at 4T here) does not achieve high  resolution anatomy as for instance ocular dominance (0.5 to 1mm resolution).  Only by using subtraction one can obtain such result (see <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273%2801%2900477-9" target="new">Cheng et al., 2001</a>). This is partly explained by the blurring  coming from the BOLD signal, which originates from the capillaries.</p>

  <h4><strong>BOLD Physiology</strong></h4>
  <p><em><strong>BOLD as a vascular response: a biomechanical model</strong></em></p>
  <p>The shape of the BOLD signal can be explained by the interplay between  &lsquo;neuronal&rsquo; oxygen consumption and blood flow.<br />
    A biomechanical model:<br />
    1. Initial undershoot = the neural oxygen consumption before any vascular  response leads to a decrease of Hb (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9771569" target="new">Yacoub et al, 1998</a>),  i.e. a decrease of the observed signal. At the onset of neural activity, dendrites  rapidly consume O2 (increase of the Cerebral Metabolic Rate of O2 (CMRO2)-<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5680/99.abstract" target="new"> Kasischke  et al, 2004</a>), leading to a reduction in oxygen pressure (pO2 - <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394001018687" target="new">Ances et al, 2001</a>) and oxyhaemoglobin (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/102/10/3822" target="new">Devor et al, 2005</a>).<br />
    2. Vascular response per se = increase of the cerebral blood flow (CBF - more Hd supplied  than consumed = increase of the signal). <a href="http://circres.ahajournals.org/content/75/1/55.abstract" target="new">Villringer  et al. (1994)</a> showed that changes in the blood flow are not linked to  capillaries recruitment but to an increase in blood cell velocity and/or capillaries dilatation. These elicit an increase of Hd.<br />
    3. Final undershoot = (hypothesis 1) an increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) due to differences between  the active response of arteries (dilatation/constriction) and the passive venous response (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910390602/abstract" target="new">Buxton et al. 1998</a>, Mandeville et al., <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291522-2594%28199911%2942:5%3C944::AID-MRM15%3E3.0.CO;2-W/abstract" target="new">1999a</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/jcbfm/journal/v19/n6/full/9590563a.html" target="new">1999b</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1522-2594%28200103%2945:3%3C443::AID-MRM1058%3E3.0.CO;2-3/abstract" target="new">2001</a>). </p>
  <p>Several studies showed that the  CBF depends on the neural response, i.e. neural activity could directly  influence smooth muscle contraction and thus the increase and undershoot of the  BOLD signal (see e.g. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909002407" target="new">Chen and Pike, 2009</a>). Importantly, the final undershoot might not be fully related to changes in CBV. Changes in CBV were observed experimentally in rodents, most of the time under anesthesia and often using long-lasting blood-pool contrast agent - and these three factors are likely to make a diffeerence. Indeed, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18201912" target="new">Frahm et al (2008) </a>for instance (see also other references in there paper) showed that in humans there was no change in CBV. In this case 3. Final undershoot = (hypothesis 2) uncoupling between normal CBF (returned to baseline) and CMRO2 ; that is there is some metabolique activity taking place after the stimulus indiced neuronal activity.</p>
<p> </p>
  <p><strong><em>BOLD as a neural response</em></strong></p>
  <p>The BOLD signal reflects the firing of neural populations such as a strong  correlation exists between the BOLD amplitude and local field potentials data (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6843/abs/412150a0.html" target="new">Logothetis, 2001</a>). This means that BOLD is more related to  synaptic activity than neural activity per se (i.e. the interplay of EPSP and  IPSP). The BOLD signal increases according to a compressive, nonlinear,  saturating function of stimulus energy. Indeed, the neural response itself may  depend nonlinearly on the stimulus energy and the BOLD signal then nonlinearly  depends on the neural signal.</p>
  
    However, various studies have shown a relative good linear coupling between  LFP and the BOLD signal. BOLD/NIRS recordings suggest a linear relation between  absolute peak amplitudes of [HbT], [HbO] and [HbR]. However the variations of  [HbT] and [HbR] did not respond linearly with the stimulus duration and the  BOLD response showed an even more non linear response than the [HbT]. This  suggests the existence of several mechanisms mediating the BOLD response which  create the non linearity with at least a first non linearity between the neural  response and the blood supply and a second non linearity during the oxygen  consumption (oxygen extraction fraction).

  <p><em>On the left, correlation LFP/BOLD as a function of the stimulus duration (<a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.physiol.66.082602.092845" target="new">Logothetis and Wandell, 2004</a>) and on the right Haemoglobin  concentrations/BOLD as a function of stimulus duration (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811907008932" target="new">Toyoda et al., 2008</a>).</em></p>
  <p><em>Non-linearities</em></p>
  <p>One strong non-linear response is observed for stimuli that are repeated for ISI below 4 sec (which is indeed used for <a href="fMRI3.html" target="new">adaptation design</a>). It is important to appreciate this effect as design with short ISI will have more variable BOLD responses - in amplitude, lantency and duration (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731556/" target="new">Zwart et al., 2009</a>), which needs to be adressed using appropriate modelling.</p>
  <p>Non-linearities,  however, seems to be caused by 'large' vessels and Spin-Echo fMRI (suppress larger vessel BOLD) at hight field revealed a much more linear relationship between BOLD and stimulus repetition down to ISI of 1sec (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760467/" target="new">Zhang et al. 2009</a>).</p>
    <p><em>Positive vs. Negative BOLD</em></p>
    <p>The relationship between neural spiking and BOLD signal is not  straightforward because it reflects synaptic activity, which means one cannot  really say if the BOLD signal relates to a neural excitation or inhibition.  Indeed, synaptic inhibition is likely to reflect positive BOLD (see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2003.09.017" target="new">Logothetis 2003</a>)  but negative BOLD seems to reflect neural decrease (<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n4/full/nn1675.html#abstract" target="new">Shmuel et al. 2006</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.09.015" target="new">Pasley et  al., 2007</a>). In addition, recent data (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v6/n1/full/nrn1589.html" target="new">Lauritzen 2005</a>) suggest that in  conditions where mainly inhibitory circuits are involved, inhibition and  negative bold response could be related. Current understanding is thus that  synaptic activity related to excitatory (EPSP) and inhibitory (IPSP) potentials  leads to observe a positive BOLD response; but a decrease in local neural  activity (e.g. related to neighbouring increase of neural activity that locally  inhibit neural spiking - see however <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/102/10/3822" target="new">Devor et al, 2005</a>)  leads to a negative BOLD response.</p>

  <p><em>On the left Serotonin (5HT) is injected during 10min (red) during a visual stimulation.

On the right, BOLD signal measured according the the receptive field suggesting the negastive BOLD reflect neural decrease (<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n4/full/nn1675.html#abstract" target="new">Shmuel et al. 2006</a>).</em></p>
  <p><strong><em>Contradictory results linking BOLD to neurons</em></strong></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7228/abs/nature07664.html" target="new">Sirotin and Das (Nature 457, 475–479 (2009)) </a>measured 1) blood  volume and 2) blood oxygenation (optical imaging) and 3) electrophysiological  activity in alert monkeys performing a fixation/relax task. The trick was that  the monkeys fixated a point of light or relax according to the colour of the  light but the imaged area was different from the one receiving light input,  i.e. imaging result were task driven, not visually driven. Blood volume and  oxygenation in V1 showed changes that followed the rhythm of the trial phases  (the colour of the light point alternated at regular intervals) even though it  was not in an area receiving the light input. The authors also found that the  signals were directly linked to the timing of the task trials: changing the  duration of the trials resulted in an equivalent change in the timing of the  haemodynamic signal. (see however, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WNP-4Y34WBP-1&amp;_user=809099&amp;_coverDate=04/01/2010&amp;_rdoc=31&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info%28#toc#6968#2010#999499997#1696123#FLA#display#Volume%29&amp;_cdi=6968&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=55&amp;_acct=C000043939&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=809099&amp;md5=3e1c2b3234f5e1a4290bb339ce421bb0" target="new"> Kleinschmidt Müller  (NeuroImage 50, 622-625 (2010))</a>. In another set of experiments, the same  team (<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v15/n9/full/nn.3170.html">Cardoso  et al., 2012 - Nature Neuroscience, 15(9), 1298-1306</a> ) showed that even for  areas receiving light input, the BOLD response is not just a reflection of  stimulus induced spiking activity. The BOLD response is better seen as a linear  sum of stimulus induced spiking activity (~50% of the variance in their data)  and a trial-related signal (anticipatory? – attention?), not related directly  to the local spiking.  </p>
  <p><img src="gfx/fmri/BOLD7.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="382" /></p>
  <p><em>From Cardoso et al. (2012) - the top row shows the spiking activity (MUA) in one session, the BOLD signal and the difference between the predicted (spiking convolved by the hrf) and observed. The bottom row shows the spiking activity in another session with the evoked and trial-related signals.</em></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/53/14347" target="new">Devor et al. (J.  Neurosci. 28, 14347–14357 (2008))</a> measured 1) blood oxygenation  (spectral imaging) 2) blood flow (laser speckle imaging) 3) metabolism  (2-deoxyglucose labelling) and 4) electrophysiological activity of the somatosensory  cortices of anaesthetized rats in response to forepaw stimulation. In the  contralateral cortex, as expected, they observed increases in spiking activity,  metabolism, blood oxygenation and blood flow. In the ipsilateral cortex, the  picture was less clear with an increase in spiking activity and metabolism but  a decrease in blood oxygenation and blood flow.</p>
    <p>--&gt; <em>Can we still then relate BOLD and Neurons</em>: Blood flow and  oxygenation can be decoupled from glucose consumption and neuronal activity  (energy consumption does not necessarily determine blood flow), but the reverse  still holds, i.e. if we observe a significant BOLD signal, we can say they was  neural activity. However, depending on the type of stimulus used, the signal  might be anticipatory rather than responsive and well designed studies and analyses  are therefore mandatory if one wants to understand / interpret those two types  of activity. As discussed by Cardoso et al. (2012) analyses that remove effects  of (blank) null trials or non specific form of global from local signal are not  confounded by this trial-related signal, just as design that compares  conditions within the same task structure or regress against a range of  intensity (parametric designs).</p>
    <p><em>The special case of the hippocampu</em><strong>s</strong></p>
    <p>Several researchers have observed a dissociation between spiking activity, LFP and BOLD signal in the hippocampus. In addition, it is often the case that negative BOLD responses are observed in memory tasks when compared to baseline measurements. One possible explanation relies on the particular low capillary vasculature of this region such as neural activity leads to an increase in oxygen consumption beyond the blood flow supply (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546820/" target="new">Ekstrom 2009</a>). </p>
    <h4><strong>How is the BOLD response mediated?</strong></h4>
  <p>The energy produced for the brain relies mainly on glucose oxidation.  However there are evidences that the increase in blood flow that leads to the  BOLD signal is not driven by the demand in oxygen. First, there are numerous  evidence of a relationship between the amount of neural activity (LFP) and the  BOLD signal. Second, decreasing the oxygen availability does not necessarily  lead to an increase in blood flow (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/98/12/6859.abstract?sid=0a5ea7f1-f6ff-4a2d-af7c-0b6feab45ad5" target="new">Mintun et al. 2001</a>) or during long period of stimulation whereas  the oxygen consumption increases; the blood flow doies not decrease (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/nimg.2002.1114" target="new">Mintun et al., 2002</a>).  Indeed, the initial dip of the BOLD, as presented earlier, represents an  increase of oxygen extraction immediately following the neural activation. One  question that thus needs to be addressed is how the vascular response is mediated from  neurons to blood.</p>
  <p><em>The Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle hypothesis</em></p>
  <p>The blood supply following neural activation doesn't come from the neurons themselves  but regional changes in neural activity trigger localized alterations in  cerebral blood flow through astrocyte activation (<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v6/n1/abs/nn980.html" target="new">Zonta  et al., 2003</a>). One hypothesis is that accompanying the neural activity, the  glycogen is transformed in glucose and degraded into pyruvate (glycolysis  +2ATP). Whereas under resting activity the pyruvate is fully degraded  (oxidative phosphorilation + 30ATP) it might be quickly degraded into lactate  under activation, i.e. because the brain uses oxygen (glycolysis) and that  glycolysis is almost twice faster than phosphorilation, lactate is  accumulating. The lactate would then be the agent which elicits an increase in  blood flow, but via the astrocytes (Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle hypothesis  (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/91/22/10625.abstract?sid=2f7cb2ef-4856-4cb7-bd1e-109837efa5c3" target="new">Pellerin &amp; Magistretti, 1994</a>: neural activity -&gt;  glutamate taken up by astrocytes via Na+ channels -&gt; NA+/K+ pump -&gt; ATP  consumption -&gt; glycolysis -&gt; lactate -&gt; oxidation by neural  mitochondria).</p>
    <p>According to this model, the glutamate is the trigger related to the neural  activity. However, other agents than the glutamate should be involved ; e.g.  Logothetis et al have shown a BOLD response with serotonin. Nevertheless, the  glutamate/ astrocyte/ glycolysis coupling might explain a good proportion of  the data. Indeed, extracellular recording and spectroscopy data (<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/88013934/abstract" target="new">Hyder  et al. 2001</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/99/16/10765.abstract?sid=90ca215f-d7b7-449c-ba59-425fa4b2d79b" target="new">Smith et al. 2002</a>) have shown that oxygen consumption changes  are proportional to changes in the amount of glutamate which correlates with  the spiking frequency (80% of neurons are excitatory ones and 90% of them are  glutamaergic). <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5907/1551.full">Rouach et al. (2008</a>) showed that the supply of energetic metabolites                          involves groups of connected astrocytes to reach   more efficiently and distally the sites of high neuronal demand. Gap   junctions                          are directly involved in the metabolic   supportive function of astrocytes by providing an activity-dependent   intercellular                          pathway for glucose delivery from blood vessels   to distal neurons.</p>
    </p>
  <p><img src="gfx/fmri/BOLD6.jpg" alt="" width="579" height="218" /> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em>Other agents mediating the vascular response</em></p>
  <p>Most recent studies also point out a special role of calcium signalling from  the astrocytes to control the vascular supply (<a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v6/n1/abs/nn980.html" target="new">Zonta  et al., 2003</a>). Glutamate uptake not only activate the Na+/K+ pump which  ultimately leads to an increase in oxygen demand (see above) but it also  elicits a raise of calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration in astrocytes, thereby  generating arachidonic acid from membrane lipids. Interestingly, arachidonic acid  can either dilate or constrict the blood arterioles to increase or decrease  blood flow, respectively. Dilation follows the conversion of arachidonic acid  to prostaglandin E2 and epoxygenase derivatives, which diffuse to the  smooth-muscle cells encircling nearby arterioles and relax them. Constriction,  by contrast, is caused by arachidonic acid itself diffusing to the smooth  muscle, where its derivative 20-HETE causes arteriole constriction by  increasing Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated channels. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7223/abs/nature07525.html" target="new">Grant et al. (2008)</a> showed that the prevailing oxygen level is a  key determinant of whether astrocytes increase or decrease blood flow. In  response to periodic 10–20-Hz stimulation of the hippocampal CA3–CA1 pathway in  conditions of high O2 concentration (95%) arterioles constricted (81.4 plus/minus  3.8%), whereas the same vessel in low O2 concentration (20%) dilated (107.6  plus/minus 0.7%) in response to the same stimulation. Lowering pO2 elevated  anaerobic metabolism, increasing external lactate. The action of PGE2  terminated when prostaglandin transporters (PGTs) take up PGE2 by an exchange  of intracellular lactate. Owing to the influence of a lactate concentration  gradient on PGT efficacy, higher levels of extracellular lactate reduced PGT  uptake of PGE2, thereby increasing the external PGE2 concentration resulting in  vasodilatation. In addition, whereas adenosine (via adenosine A2A receptors)  usually induces vasoconstriction, the low-O2 environment causes an elevation in  extracellular adenosine which prevented astrocyte-mediated vasoconstriction.  Overall, these results suggest that by lowering pO2, astrocyte-induced  responses convert to vasodilatations from vasoconstrictions. </p>
